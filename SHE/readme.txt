hello

-- First, open file myfun.m and set harmonics to eliminate in n vector and run it
   (don't care if any error occurred)
-- Second, open file SHE.m and run it.
-- Third, open the simulink and open SHE_simulink.slx and enjoy ;) 
my matlab version is 2017a consider this for any possible problem for simulink
